# Local Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) Engine

A local, offline, privacy-preserving streaming speech-to-text engine for Windows — built on bare
ONNX Runtime / Windows ML, cross-hardware (CPU / GPU / NPU), multilingual with a focus on
**Chinese–English code-switching**. Two-pass design: a streaming first pass emits live partial
subtitles, and on end-of-sentence an offline model re-decodes the whole segment for the final
text.

> The repository is named `tts-winui3` for historical reasons; the actual target is **STT**
> (speech-to-text), not TTS. See [the design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-28-local-stt-engine-design.md).

## Status

**Phase 0 (offline single-pass + infrastructure) is implemented and verified.** You can speak a
sentence and get Chinese–English mixed offline transcription (once you supply the native fbank
shim + models — see [SETUP](docs/native/SETUP.md)). Headless tests: **75 passing**, plus skippable
integration tests that activate when native binaries/models are present.

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | mic → VAD → kaldi-fbank → SenseVoice (ORT) → text; infra; load validation; UI | ✅ implemented |
| 1 | streaming Zipformer transducer → two-pass; live partials | ⏳ planned ([plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-28-local-stt-engine.md)) |
| 2 | DirectML GPU | ⏳ planned |
| 3 | NPU (QNN/OpenVINO/VitisAI); optional Whisper-genai plugin | ⏳ planned |

## Architecture (spec §4, D5)

Layered, one-directional `App → Core/Audio → Abstractions`:

```
Stt.sln
├─ src/
│  ├─ Stt.Abstractions   (net8.0)                interfaces + DTOs + enums, zero third-party deps
│  ├─ Stt.Core           (net8.0)                engine: Audio, Features, Vad, Decoders, Ep, Models, Pipeline
│  ├─ Stt.Audio.Windows  (net8.0-windows)        WASAPI capture (NAudio)
│  └─ Stt.App            (net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0, WinUI3)  full-trust unpackaged app
└─ tests/
   ├─ Stt.Core.Tests     (net8.0, xUnit)         WAV → text, feature/decoder/validation units
   └─ Stt.Pipeline.Tests (net8.0, xUnit)         channel backpressure, lifecycle, offline pipeline
```

`Stt.Core` never references `Microsoft.UI.*`, so the full recognition chain is headless-testable:
`FileAudioCapture` feeds a WAV through VAD → features → decode with no microphone and no UI.

## Build & test

Requires the **.NET SDK** (8.0+; this repo builds on .NET 10). The class libraries and tests are
`net8.0` (AnyCPU); the app is `net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0` (x64 / ARM64).

```bash
# Headless engine + tests (cross-platform-ish; ONNX native is win/x64 at runtime)
dotnet test tests/Stt.Core.Tests/Stt.Core.Tests.csproj
dotnet test tests/Stt.Pipeline.Tests/Stt.Pipeline.Tests.csproj
```

### Building the WinUI app

The WinUI app needs the MRT/PRI build task that ships with **Visual Studio's MSBuild** (the
`dotnet` SDK alone lacks it). Build with VS MSBuild:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64\MSBuild.exe" `
  src\Stt.App\Stt.App.csproj -p:Platform=x64 -p:Configuration=Debug -restore
```

To **run** the app, install the WinUI tooling + `winapp` CLI via the `/winui-setup` workflow, then
use `winapp run` / `BuildAndRun.ps1` (never launch the packaged exe directly).

## Running end-to-end

Phase 0 needs three user-supplied pieces (none are committed — D7):

1. The native **kaldi-fbank shim** (`kaldi_native_fbank_shim.dll`) — see
   [docs/native/kaldi-native-fbank.md](docs/native/kaldi-native-fbank.md).
2. A **Silero VAD** ONNX model.
3. A **SenseVoice-Small** ONNX model folder (+ `tokens.txt`, CMVN in metadata).
